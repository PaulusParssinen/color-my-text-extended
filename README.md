# Color My Text Extended

A fork of [Color My Text](https://github.com/JatinSanghvi/color-my-text-vscode) to extend it for my own needs.

## Changes

- Remove color limitations and allow full customization of the matches
- Allow matching by regex groups
- When hovering over the match, show the respective capture group and optional description
- Some minor additions for my needs
  - Allow (weird) "exhaustive" matching per line

## Planned

- Allow named wildcard capture groups

## Build

`npm run build`
